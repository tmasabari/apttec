<strong>Limitations</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>We can practically do anything with JS from browser. But for security reasons JavaScript can’t read or write files on the client comuter</li>
</ol>
<strong>Features</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>JQuery and a host of other frameworks have made JavaScript much more practical for building complex applications,</li>
 	<li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has all but supplanted XML for data transmission</li>
 	<li>Node.js, which just won another InfoWorld Bossie award, has provided a powerful way for JavaScript to address the server side</li>
 	<li>“JavaScript beats native code for mobile,”
<ol>
 	<li>While it’s true that for general computation of mathematical operations native code should be able to run circles around JavaScript (and compute those circles while doing it), that viewpoint ignores the fact that far different operations are performed in many apps and JavaScript-based apps often equal or beat native code for those operations</li>
 	<li>very smart programmers have been tweaking browsers for years to optimize the speed of those operations.</li>
 	<li>More exciting is their exploration of <strong>RiverTrail, a parallel programming model and API</strong> for JavaScript developed by Intel</li>
 	<li>Mozilla research project <strong><a href="http://asmjs.org/faq.html">asm.js</a>,</strong> which “defines a subset of JavaScript that can be generated by compilers and <strong>highly optimized by JavaScript VMs.</strong>”</li>
 	<li>While asm.js has been cited for its usefulness in game development, enterprise applications also can benefit from it
<ol>
 	<li>“Advantage number 1, you get to compile existing C and C++ code – and there’s a lot of that code out there. You can compile it and run it very fast on the Web</li>
 	<li>The second advantage is that it’s a neat compilation target for languages that are not JavaScript. You can more easily compile some languages so that they’ll run on the Web platform and they’ll run very fast</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">WebAssembly </a>or <i>wasm</i> is a new <strong>portable, size- and load-time-efficient format</strong> suitable for compilation to the web.
<ol>
 	<li>WebAssembly is currently being designed as an open standard by a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/">W3C Community Group</a> that includes representatives from all major browsers.</li>
 	<li>This new standard will enable amazing video games and high-performance web apps for things like computer-aided design, video and image editing, and scientific visualization. Over time, many existing productivity apps (e.g. email, social networks, word processing) and JavaScript frameworks will likely use WebAssembly to significantly reduce load times while simultaneously improving performance while running.</li>
 	<li>Unlike other approaches that have required plug-ins to achieve near-native performance in the browser, WebAssembly runs entirely within the Web Platform. This means that developers can integrate WebAssembly libraries for CPU-intensive calculations (e.g. compression, face detection, physics) into existing web apps that use JavaScript for less intensive work.</li>
 	<li>Web apps written with WebAssembly can run at near-native speeds because, unlike JavaScript, all the code a programmer writes is parsed and compiled ahead of time before reaching the browser. The browser then just sees low-level, machine-ready instructions it can quickly validate, optimize, and run.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FAQ.md">Why create a new standard when there is already asm.js?</a>
<ol>
 	<li>The kind of binary format being considered for WebAssembly can be natively decoded much faster than JavaScript can be parsed (<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/BinaryEncoding.md#why-a-binary-encoding-instead-of-a-text-only-representation">experiments</a> show more than 20× faster). On mobile, large compiled codes can easily take 20–40 seconds <em>just to parse</em>, so native decoding (especially when combined with other techniques like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/streams-api/">streaming</a> (<a href="https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/">latest streaming specs</a>) for better-than-gzip compression) is critical to providing a good cold-load user experience.</li>
 	<li>By avoiding the simultaneous asm.js constraints of <a href="http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/#ahead-of-time-compilation">AOT</a>-<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/luke/2014/01/14/asm-js-aot-compilation-and-startup-performance/">compilability</a> and good performance even on engines without<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/luke/2015/02/18/microsoft-announces-asm-js-optimizations/#asmjs-opts">specific asm.js optimizations</a>, a new standard makes it <em>much easier</em> to add the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FutureFeatures.md">features <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" alt=":unicorn:" width="20" height="20" /></a> required to reach native levels of performance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Safe</h3>
WebAssembly describes a memory-safe, sandboxed <a href="http://webassembly.org/docs/semantics/#linear-memory">execution environment</a> that may even be implemented inside existing JavaScript virtual machines. When <a href="http://webassembly.org/docs/web/">embedded in the web</a>, WebAssembly will enforce the same-origin and permissions security policies of the browser.</li>
 	<li>WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of <a href="http://webassembly.org/docs/portability/#assumptions-for-efficient-execution">common hardware capabilities</a> available on a wide range of platforms.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Part of the open web platform</h3>
WebAssembly is designed to maintain the <strong>versionless, feature-tested, and backwards-compatible</strong> <a href="http://webassembly.org/docs/web/">nature of the web</a>. WebAssembly modules will be able to call into and out of the JavaScript context and access browser functionality through the same Web APIs accessible from JavaScript. WebAssembly also supports <a href="http://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/">non-web</a>embeddings.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Plus, progress is being made as we speak in more advanced in-browser operations such as 3D rendering</li>
</ol>

<h2>The JavaScript ecosystem</h2>
Along with jQuery and Node.js, this year’s Best of Open Source Software Awards showcased seven JavaScript winners:
<ul>
 	<li>AngularJS, a toolset for turning static HTML pages into JavaScript applications, with support for <strong>MVC architecture</strong></li>
 	<li>Backbone.js, a JavaScript library that enables developers to add structure to apps and <strong>represent data as Models</strong></li>
 	<li>Bootstrap, a responsive <strong>Web design framework</strong> intended to be used in conjunction with JQuery</li>
 	<li>Enyo, an object-oriented JavaScript framework that can be used to build <strong>HTML5/CSS apps</strong></li>
 	<li>D3, a JavaScript library that pushes vector <strong>graphics </strong>about as far as it can go in the browser, no plug-ins necessary</li>
 	<li>Ember.js, an up-and-coming JavaScript framework for developing <strong>MVC applications</strong> with rich functionality</li>
 	<li>Emscripten, a compiler that <strong>converts C++ into asm.js</strong>, Mozilla’s highly optimizable subset of JavaScript</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>Is WebAssembly trying to replace JavaScript?</h2>
No! WebAssembly is designed to be a complement to, not replacement of, JavaScript. While WebAssembly will, over time, allow many languages to be compiled to the Web, JavaScript has an incredible amount of momentum and will remain the single, privileged (as described <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FAQ.md#is-webassembly-only-for-cc-programmers">above</a>) dynamic language of the Web. Furthermore, it is expected that JavaScript and WebAssembly will be used together in a number of configurations:
<ul>
 	<li>Whole, compiled C++ apps that leverage JavaScript to glue things together.</li>
 	<li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI around a main WebAssembly-controlled center canvas, allowing developers to leverage the power of web frameworks to build accessible, web-native-feeling experiences.</li>
 	<li>Mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript app with a few high-performance WebAssembly modules (e.g., graphing, simulation, image/sound/video processing, visualization, animation, compression, etc., examples which we can already see in asm.js today) allowing developers to reuse popular WebAssembly libraries just like JavaScript libraries today.</li>
 	<li>When WebAssembly <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FutureFeatures.md#gcdom-integration">gains the ability to access garbage-collected objects <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" alt=":unicorn:" width="20" height="20" /></a>, those objects will be shared with JavaScript, and not live in a walled-off world of their own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4 supercool JavaScript tools for <a href="http://www.apttec.com/data-visualization-or-data-visualisation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data visualization</a></h2>
This age of interactive data visualization rests largely on capabilities provided by JavaScript libraries designed specifically for the task. In this article, we’ll look at four such libraries: D3, InfoVis, Processing.js, and Recline.js. All of these libraries can be used to adorn your Web page with dynamic data visualizations, but each takes a different approach to providing that capability. And all four are free to use and redistribute under open source licenses.

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Digital media time spent using mobile devices reached 68%</strong> in the U.S. That leaves only 32% of digital media time for using desktop or laptop computers.</li>
 	<li>According to a study by Criteo, <strong>35% of online purchases</strong> in Q2 2016 in the USA happened on mobile devices.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mobile web is getting more visitors than mobile apps. 49% of smartphone users download 0 apps per month</strong></li>
 	<li>Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>.</li>
 	<li>Since April 21st, 2015, Google started expanding its use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://mobiforge.com/research-analysis/13-statistics-on-mobile-web-performance-in-2017">Mobile web performance 2017</a>
<ul>
 	<li>The average <strong>page weight is over 2.3MB</strong></li>
 	<li>According to a report by Google published in September 2016, as much as 53% of mobile users abandon websites that take longer than <strong>3 seconds to load</strong>.</li>
 	<li>In February 2016, Ericsson released an interesting <strong>neuroscience study </strong>measuring user reactions to web performance hiccups while completing tasks under time constraints. It revealed that experiencing <strong>delays in loading web pages and videos was comparable to watching a horror movie</strong>.</li>
 	<li>According to Google, it takes <strong>19 seconds on average</strong> (average website weighs over 2.3MB) to load a website on a phone connected to a 3G network. According to Google <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/new-industry-benchmarks-for-mobile-page-speed/">research</a>, 70 percent of conventional mobile pages take seven to 10 seconds for visual page content to load.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://mobiforge.com/news-comment/adaptive-web-design-dominates-in-the-webs-top-brands">80% of Alexa top 100 use adaptive design</a> including the largest players, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter.</li>

<h2>How to Develop ?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>A site designed with RWD<sup id="cite_ref-fluid_grid_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-fluid_grid-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids,<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-EM_FG_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-EM_FG-8">[8]</a></sup> flexible images,<sup id="cite_ref-EM_FI_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-EM_FI-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-EM_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-EM-11">[11]</a></sup> and <a title="Cascading Style Sheets" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3">CSS3</a> <a title="Media queries" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">media queries</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-ZMGflexEx_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-ZMGflexEx-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ZMGmediaQ_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-ZMGmediaQ-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> an extension of the <code>@media</code> rule, in the following ways:<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></li>
 	<li>The<strong> fluid <a title="Grid (page layout)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(page_layout)#Grid_use_in_web_design">grid</a> concept </strong>calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like <strong>percentages, rather than absolute units</strong> like <a title="Pixel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixels</a>or <a title="Point (typography)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)">points</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-EM_FG_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-EM_FG-8">[8]</a></sup></li>
 	<li>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing <a title="HTML element" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">element</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-EM_FI_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design#cite_note-EM_FI-9">[9]</a></sup></li>
 	<li><strong><a title="Media queries" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">Media queries</a></strong> allow the page to use <strong>different CSS style rules </strong>based on characteristics of the <strong>device </strong>the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.</li>
 	<li>A website can be made responsive or <strong>mobile-friendly by adding <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Media Queries</a>.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Media queries let the display of content be according to the user device without having to change the content itself.</li>
 	<li>It is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. Media queries allow the web page to use different CSS style rules based on the features such as width, height, and color.  A media query is a logical expression that is either true or false. When a media query is true, the relevant style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.</li>

 	<li>You can test how mobile-friendly the page is on <a href="https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-in</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the code</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>By comparison, AMP (<b>Accelerated Mobile Pages)</b> pages load in less than one second, on average.
<ul>
 	<li>The <b>Accelerated Mobile Pages</b> Project (<b>AMP</b>) is an online publishing format, created by <a title="Google" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> as a competitor to <a title="Facebook" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>'s <a title="Instant Articles" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Articles">Instant Articles</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> that is similar to HTML and optimized for mobile web browsing. Using special code, AMP-HTML is intended to help webpages load rapidly when clicked in the Google search results pages, though results have varied.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-daringfireball1_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages#cite_note-daringfireball1-3">[3]</a></sup></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-vs-responsive-web-design-speed-flexibility-rakshit-patel">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-vs-responsive-web-design-speed-flexibility-rakshit-patel</a></li>
 	<li><sup><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/facebook-instant-articles-vs-google-amp/">https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/facebook-instant-articles-vs-google-amp/</a></sup></li>
 	<li><sup><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/wired/">https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/wired/</a></sup></li>
 	<li>AMP is designed for static pages. Developers have to make two different pages: normal version and AMP version. The AMP page will have a link to the normal page and vice versa. Whenever a request comes to normal page from mobile it will load AMP page and vice versa. Google have its own AMP cache to load is faster. While developing AMP pages we just have to consider the AMP rules.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec">https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components">https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Publishers report more time on-site and greater user engagement for AMP pages. They also say they’re seeing higher CTRs, and even better monetization, with AMP.</li>
 	<li>Google have seen an incredible global adoption of AMP that has gone beyond the news industry to include e-commerce, entertainment, travel, recipe sites and so on
<ul>
 	<li>Adobe reported last month that top US publishers are now seeing 7 percent of their traffic through AMP pages.</li>
 	<li>In March 2017 that there were 1.7 billion AMP pages available on 860,000 domains. He said that 35 million new AMP pages were added every week</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Many of the technologies disallowed by AMP HTML, like <strong>iframes</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, are considered foundational to modern websites. As a result, publishers who want to create articles for Google AMP are essentially required to create parallel versions of their content, which is a significant investment of time and resources.</li>
 	<li>You can validate AMP on <a href="https://validator.ampproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://validator.ampproject.org/</a></li>

<h3>AMP vs Responsive Web Design</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>https://www.searchenginejournal.com/difference-accelerated-mobile-pages-amp-mobile-friendly-pages/172967/</li>
 	<li>Accelerated mobile pages and responsive websites will both work on a mobile phone, but the AMP Project and Responsive Web Design have <strong>different goals</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Responsive Web Design is a method of organizing and designing a website so that it works on any device, from a desktop computer to a mobile phone. It could be said that <strong>RWD is focused on flexibility</strong>.</li>
 	<li>The AMP Project is a web framework designed for delivering content to mobile users instantly. <strong>AMP is focused on speed</strong>. Malte Ubl, Google’s Tech Lead for the AMP Project, wrote a great summary of <a title="Why AMP is fast" href="https://medium.com/@cramforce/why-amp-is-fast-7d2ff1f48597">why AMP is fast</a>.</li>
 	<li>How this works with SPA (Single Page Apps) and other javascript front-end heavy frameworks is unknown at this point, that is for those developers to figure out.</li>
