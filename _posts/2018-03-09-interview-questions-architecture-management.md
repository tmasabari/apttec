<h2>Tell me about yourself</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>My name is Sabarinathan. I'm a MCA and MBA graduate. I've 13 years of experience in IT.</li>
 	<li>Out of it I have 11 years of exp. in .NET platform and 4 years of experience as an architet  integrating enterprise applications.</li>
 	<li>Currently I'm working (recently i worked) as an architect for Virtusa. Through my technical skill I've provided optimum solution and integration to Citi applications.</li>
 	<li>In my current role I handle technical project execution in whole SDLC process and participate in RFPs and technical solutions to the critical applications.</li>
 	<li>I have well experienced in training, mentoring and motivating team members as well.</li>
 	<li>I'm writing technical articles in my blog and code project.</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The achievements should exhibit a PAR (Problem-Action-Result) Pattern</strong></span></li>
 	<li></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><b>Step 1: Give a brief introduction about yourself:</b>

<strong>- Education &amp; </strong>Total years of experience
<strong>- </strong>Present / last position with the present / last company associated with
<strong>- </strong>Stints taken across the career supporting your target functional areas
- Your personal work-style and unique personality traits

<b>Step 2: Give a brief summary of your experience in your latest positions:</b>Give a summary of 2-3 latest companies that you have worked for and companies that have helped you succeed with your new jobs. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(E-e:After 6 months, my sales force and I did regain the company’s market and promote the sales revenue up by 37%.)</span>

The achievements should exhibit a PAR (Problem-Action-Result) Pattern to exemplify the benefit of the action taken to you as an individual and organization as a whole. The accomplishments should also be quantified to add credibility to your resume. Moreover, you can use percentages as a metric to highlight your efforts.

<b>Step 3: Connect your ability to the employer’s requirements:</b>Never assume that the employer will by himself be able to connect all of your abilities to the job requirements.

<b>Step 4: Make a concerning question:</b>With a concerning question, it will help you gain “control” of the interview. You may reduce the stress of the interview with such questions. For example: I would like to know the strong points of your company’s current team.</blockquote>
<h2>How Would You Describe Your Role in Your Last Team Project?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>The potential employer is interested in knowing how capable you are of working with others and whether you are likely to recognize their accomplishments or blame them for a project’s problems.</li>
 	<li>Most questions invite you to <strong>brag a little about your skills and accomplishments</strong>, but your response to this question should <strong>emphasize the role of others on your team</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Describe your responsibilities and demonstrate how the team worked together to achieve your common goal.</li>
</ul>
https://www.developer.com/mgmt/slideshows/top-10-interview-questions-a-solution-architect-should-know.html
<h2 id="slide_title">What's the most innovative solution you've ever come up with?</h2>
<div id="slide_body">

A: The answer will vary, but a candidate should discuss a solution that is non-obvious.
<h2 id="slide_title">How do you approach security in your solutions?</h2>
<div id="slide_body">

A: A candidate's answer should refer to at least authentication as well as authorization. If forms are mentioned, the candidate should include solutions for password management.
<div id="slide_body">
<h4 id="slide_body"></h4>
<h2 id="slide_title">Q4: What tools do you use for communicating architecture?</h2>
<div id="slide_body">

A: A candidate's answer should include mechanisms for creating and distributing pictures of the solution with an appropriate number of boxes and arrows. Any solutions architect will recognize the need for both written communication and pictures. Lots of solution architects can draw pictures, but they're often not enough to convey a complete understanding.
<h2 id="slide_title">Q5: How do you support the functional analysts (FA)?</h2>
<div id="slide_body">

A: The answer to this question should explain how the candidate would work with the FA and answer their questions—as well as reflect clarifying questions. A successful solution architect is happy to help the FA however they can, and should show a readiness to co-operate. Ultimately, the solutions architect is the technical leader of the team and needs to support teamwork.
<h2 id="slide_title">Q6: How do you support the development leads?</h2>
<div id="slide_body">

A: Similar to supporting the functional analysts, solution architects are resources for the development leads to help them solve the problems that are occurring while development is actually taking place. A good candidate will recognize their importance in helping the development leads find solutions to their problems.
<h2>Characteristics of Modern Web Applications and .NET Core</h2>
<a href="https://ardalis.com/when-should-you-upgrade-to-asp-net-core">When to upgrade to .NET Core and Microsoft architecture book</a>
<ul>
 	<li>Cloud-Hosted and Scalable
<ul>
 	<li>The smaller footprint of ASP.NET Core applications means you can
host more of them on the same hardware, and you pay for fewer resources when using pay-as-you go cloud hosting services</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Cross Platform
<ul>
 	<li>Docker containers, which typically run Linux today, can host ASP.NET Core applications, allowing them to take advantage of the benefits of containers and microservices</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Modular and Loosely Coupled
<ul>
 	<li>fully supports dependency injection, both internally and at the application level.</li>
 	<li>NuGet packages are first-class citizens in .NET Core, and ASP.NET Core apps are composed of many libraries through NuGet. This granularity of functionality helps ensure apps only depend on and deploy functionality they actually require, reducing their footprint and security vulnerability surface area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Easily Tested with Automated Tests
<ul>
 	<li>ASP.NET Core also ships a TestServer that can be used to host apps in memory. Functional tests can then make requests to this in-memory server, exercising the full application stack (including middleware, routing, model binding, filters, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Traditional (MVC) and SPA Behaviors Supported</li>
 	<li>Simple Development and Deployment
<ul>
 	<li>Deployments can easily be automated to occur as part of a continuous
integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline.</li>
 	<li>In addition to traditional CI/CD tools, Windows Azure has integrated support for Git repositories and can automatically <strong>deploy updates as they are made to a specified Git branch or tag.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

There are four major components of .NET architecture:
<ul>
 	<li>· <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/common-type-system">Common language specification</a> (CLS) defines how objects are implemented so they work everywhere .NET works. CLS is a subset of Common Type System (CTS) — which sets a common way to describe all types.</li>
 	<li>· <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg145045(v=vs.110).aspx">Framework class library</a> (FCL) is a standard library that collects reusable classes, interfaces, and value types.</li>
 	<li>· <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr">Common language runtime</a> (CLR) is the virtual machine that runs the framework and manages the execution of .NET programs.</li>
 	<li>· Tools such as <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a> to create standalone applications, interactive websites, web applications and web services</li>

<h3>.NET Core vs .NET Framework</h3>
<a href="https://stackify.com/net-core-vs-net-framework/"><u>https://stackify.com/net-core-vs-net-framework/</u></a>

.NET Core provides a <strong>standard base library that can now be used across Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile devices</strong> (via Xamarin).

Microsoft maintains both runtimes for building applications with .NET and they share many of the same APIs. This shared API is what is called the .<strong>NETStandard</strong>.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wps77B4.tmp_.jpg"><img class="" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="wps77B4.tmp" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wps77B4.tmp_thumb.jpg" alt="wps77B4.tmp" width="312" height="178" border="0" /></a>

· <b>Microservices are being used.</b><a href="https://stackify.com/what-are-microservices/">Microservices</a>, a form of service-oriented architecture, are software applications comprised of small, modular business services. Each service can run a unique process, be deployed independently and be created in different programming applications. <strong>.NET Core allows a mix of technologies</strong>, is lightweight and can be minimized for each microservice. It is scalable as new <strong>microservices</strong> are added.Entity Framework Core

<h3>WCF VS Web API</h3>
<strong>What is the benefit of using REST in Web API?</strong>

WCF services use the SOAP protocol while HTTP never use SOAP protocol. That’s why WebAPI services are lightweight since SOAP is not used. It also reduces the data which is transferred to resume service. Moreover, it never needs too much configuration. Therefore, the client can interact with the service by using the HTTP verbs.

REST is used to make fewer data transfers between client and server which make it an ideal for using it in mobile apps. Web API also supports HTTP protocol. Therefore, it reintroduces the traditional way of the HTTP verbs for communication.

Following table further illustrate point by point difference between SOAP-based WCF Service and Web API.

<strong><em>connected and disconnected architecture.</em></strong>

ADO.NET provides the following two models for accessing data from a Data Source:
<ol>
 	<li>Connection Oriented Architecture</li>
 	<li>Disconnected Oriented Architecture</li>
</ol>
<strong>1. Connection Oriented Architecture</strong>

In this case we require a continuous connection with the Data Source for accessing data in it.

Here the “DataReader” class holds the data on client machines.

<strong>2. Disconnected Oriented Architecture</strong>

In this case we do not require a continuous connection with the Data Source for accessing data.

Here the “DataSet” class holds the data in the client machines.
