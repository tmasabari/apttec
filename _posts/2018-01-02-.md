<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/client_server_architecture.html">client/server architecture</a>
A network architecture in which each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server.

<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/client.html">client</a>
The client part of a client-server architecture. Typically, a client is an application that runs on a personal computer or workstation and relies on a server to perform some operations.

<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/server.html">server</a>
A computer or device on a network that manages network resources. Servers are often dedicated, meaning that they perform no other tasks besides their server tasks.

<h3>Thin Clients</h3>

<h3>Thick Clients</h3>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- Easy to deploy as they require no extra or specialized software installation- Needs to validate with the server after data capture

- If the server goes down, data collection is halted as the client needs constant communication with the server

- Cannot be interfaced with other equipment (in plants or factory settings for example)

- Clients run only and exactly as specified by the server

- More downtime

-Portability in that all applications are on the server so any workstation can access

- Opportunity to use older, outdated PCs as clients

- Reduced security threat</td>
<td>- More expensive to deploy and more work for IT to deploy- Data verified by client not server (immediate validation)

- Robust technology provides better uptime

- Only needs intermittent communication with server

- More expensive to deploy and more work for IT to deploy

- Require more resources but less servers

- Can store local files and applications

- Reduced server demands

- Increased security issues</td>
