Direct side-by-side comparisons aren't always possible between two service providers like Azure and Amazon, but some of them are close enough. The table below is an attempt at making those comparisons. This list of services is far from complete.

<h3 class="h3"><a href="http://www.saviantconsulting.com/blog/7-reasons-why-azure-is-better-than-AWS.aspx">7 Reasons Why Azure Is Better Than AWS</a></h3>
<strong>PaaS Capabilities</strong>
Both Azure and AWS offer similar IaaS capabilities for virtual machines, networking, and storage. However, Azure provides stronger PaaS capabilities which is an important piece of Cloud infrastructure today.

Microsoft Azure PaaS provides application developers with the environment, tools, and building blocks that they need to rapidly build and deploy new cloud services. It also provides the vital ‘dev-ops’ connections which are important for monitoring, managing, and continually fine tuning those apps. With <strong>Azure PaaS, much of the infrastructure management is taken care of behind the scenes</strong> by Microsoft. Thus, <a href="http://www.saviantconsulting.com/azure-development.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing Azure PaaS solutions</a> allow for a 100% focus on innovation.

<strong>.Net Compatibility</strong>
Azure’s compatibility with the .Net programming language is one of the most useful benefits of Azure, which gives Microsoft a clear upper hand over AWS and the rest of the competitors. Azure has been built and optimized to work consistently with both old and new applications developed using the .Net programming framework. It is much easier and straightforward for enterprises to move their Windows apps to Azure Cloud as opposed to AWS or others. Thus for the several organizations that use .Net based enterprise apps, Azure is the obvious choice.

<strong>Security Offerings</strong>
Azure has been designed based on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Development Lifecycle</a> (SDL) which is an industry leading assurance process. It comprises security at its core and private data and services stay secured and protected while they are on Azure Cloud.

Microsoft was the first Cloud vendor to be approved by the European Union’s data protection authorities and the Article 29 Working Party. They were also the first to embrace the new international standard for Cloud privacy, ISO 27018. Thus, Microsoft guarantees the best in terms of safety for all operations and data on the Azure Cloud.

<strong>Hybrid solutions for Seamless Cloud Connectivity </strong>
While Amazon is still testing the hybrid waters, Azure already has its hybrid capabilities in place. It seamlessly connects datacenters to the Cloud. Azure provides a consistent platform which facilities easy mobility between on-premises and the public Cloud.

Unlike AWS, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/campaigns/azure-vs-aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hybrid apps</a> can be developed on Azure which can take advantage of the resources available within datacenters, at the service provider’s end, or within Azure itself. Azure also provides a broader range of hybrid connections including virtual private networks (VPNs), caches, content delivery networks (CDNs), and ExpressRoute connections to improve usability and performance.

<strong>Integrated Environment</strong>
Azure brings to the table an integrated environment for developing, testing, and deploying Cloud apps. The choice of frameworks lies with the client, and open development languages further add to the flexibility for <a href="http://www.saviantconsulting.com/azure-migration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure migration.</a> Additionally, readymade services like web, mobile, media in addition to APIs and templates can be leveraged to kick start Azure application development. Azure PaaS brings together all the applications, data, devices, and partners, both on-premises and in the Cloud. Its flexible toolset is ideal for solving integration needs ranging from connecting mobile apps with on-premises LOB systems, to coordinating B2B payments with partners.

<strong>Gentle Learning Curve</strong>
AWS is widely perceived as being complicated. This is evident by the numerous tutorials, user guides, and troubleshooting documents that are out there. Conversely, Azure allows the utilization of the same tried and trusted technologies that several businesses have used in the past and are still using today. These include Windows and Linux, Active Directory, and virtual machines. Moreover it provides useful tools like XCode, Hadoop, Github, Visual Studios, Eclipse etc. It also provides several third party tools, solutions, and apps developed by partner-developers on the Azure Marketplace. As a result the learning curve for the Azure Cloud is gentle.

<strong>The 'Enterprise Agreement' Advantage</strong>
If an organization already uses Microsoft software, then it likely has the ‘Enterprise Agreement’ with Microsoft. It is entitled to obtain discounts on the Microsoft software being used as Microsoft usually tweaks these agreements to lower the pricing of Azure. Thus, with the enterprise agreement, enterprises can typically obtain significant incentives for using Azure.
<h3><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4284830/windows-azure-or-amazon-ec2-for-asp-net-mvc-development">Scenario 1</a>:</h3>
If you want to build enterprise ASP.NET MVC applications that use MSSQL databases is it better to use Windows Azure or Amazon EC2?

Since you want to use Microsoft SQL Server, Azure's SQL Azure is going to be a good fit. Further, if you deploy your application into an Azure Web Role (a role is a virtual machine with a specific template, and a web role specifically runs IIS), you can then work directly with your SQL Azure databases in the same data center without incurring any bandwidth charges or Internet latency between your app and your database.

One clarification: SQL Azure <em>does</em> triple-replicate your data. This replication is instant, so keep this in mind when you DELETE * FROM CUSTOMERS, as this deletion is also triple-replicated. Consider this when planning your backup strategy (maybe take advantage of Azure's sync service to periodically back up to another database, either in Azure or on-premises).

&nbsp;

Both are for slightly different purposes -

Amazon is infrastructure as a service, which means you dont have to purchase hardwrae, the networking equipment and maintain them. You will get virtual machines that can host linux or windows OS and can easily install any framework, web server or applications you want on it to use for hosting web apps or web services or long running processes. You are still responsible for maintaining the operating system which means that you still need to apply upgrade patches, protect against viruses, and are completely responsible to ensure that the OS does not crash.

Windows azure is a platform-as-a-service - you basically get windows VMs like in Amazon, but the operating system management and the application framework is also completely abstracted away from you. It allows for automatic OS upgrades and maintenance. Also this means you just load your app and it starts working - no need to worry about the low level details.

While this reduces the control you have over what you can install and what you can't it gives you much lesser operational overhead since you don't need a lot of administrative effort in maintaining your instances. Also scaling up and down, load balancing, auto high uptime, all these are handled by the azure service controller (or the fabric controller).

Sql azure is one step ahead in this direction - you dont even have to consider a VM, you just get a particular size db in the cloud, and you pay for what you use. The data is seemingly triple replicated and hence there is very good reliability built in. It is much cheaper to have this at least for smaller databases than to have a full blown instance for an sql server.

MS is also introducing some features like windows server vms which will give you an option for having amazon like instances, but I personally like the current azure better.

So to summarize - for new asp.net mvc applications, with sql server backend, windows azure is a great platform to build on. On the other hand, if you have an existing website which has a lot of dependency on legacy components that are not supported by windows azure, amazon will be a far better choice. Also Amazon will be slightly cheaper for an instance of same size (though the pricing structures can vary depending on the commitment you want to give).
