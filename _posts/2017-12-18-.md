<li>Today's IT Career ;; you spend 25to 27 yrs of study to make a career and then work max for 12 to 15 yrs , then go: I have seen managers from reputed companies after 2+ yrs of Jobless opening up Grocery stores.</li>
<li>Every organization has a bad habit, USE AND THROW. Don't stay more than 3 years with any company.</li>
<li>Vdsi layoff taught every IT employee, don't sacrifice any thing for company but do work to get salary.</li>
<li>Don't spoil your personal life for company and project. You need to be selfish in learning/ personal growth and personal time spending. Too many opportunities there outside other than technical work also in it to contribute. Awake and arise</li>
<li>We have loans to clear.We have to pay the fees of our children and provide them a secure future.We have aged parents whose medical bills we have to pay and take care of their recurring health issues.We have husbands who lost their jobs in recent recession.We are the only working person in our family.Each one of us have responsibilities to fulfill.</li>
<li>who ever did Jing Jung of managers/management, they are safe. Most of the underperforming managers in cofee team are retained so how this had to be taken.</li>
<li><strong>Come 2022, over a third of India’s workforce will be in jobs requiring new skills. </strong>In fact, 9% of such jobs don’t even exist today and <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/2017/12/13/in-the-next-five-years-9-of-indians-will-be-in-jobs-that-dont-exist-right-now" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">about 21% people</a> would face an “existential threat” due to new technologies, says a <a href="http://ficci.in/pressrelease/2874/FICCI-press-sep15-gss2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FICCI-NASSCOM report</a>. IT/BPM will be the most impacted, with 60-65% of the workforce in new job roles such as VFX artist, computer vision engineer, embedded system programmer, data architect and AI research scientist. With new roles like automobile analytics engineer and 3D printing technician, the automotive industry will also require professionals to keep up with the times.</li>
<li>புதிய தொழில்நுட்பங்களுக்குத் தயாராவதில் உள்ள சிரமங்களால், அடுத்து வரும் மூன்றாண்டுகளில், ஐடி பணியாளர்களும் பொறியாளர்களும் லட்சக்கணக்கில் வேலை இழக்கும் அபாயம் ஏற்பட்டுள்ளதாக, ‘ஹெட் ஹன்டர்ஸ் இந்தியா’ நிறுவனம் அறிவிப்பு வெளியிட்டுள்ளது.</li>
<li><strong>புதிதாகக் கற்றுக்கொள்வதில் உள்ள சிரமங்களால், 35 வயதுக்கு மேற்பட்டோர்</strong> வேலை இழக்கும் அபாயம் உள்ளது. மேலும், இனி வரும் காலங்களில் வேலை இழக்கும் ஐடி நிறுவன ஊழியர்களுக்கு வேறு வேலை கிடைப்பதிலும் பல சிரமங்கள் உள்ளன’ எனக் குறிப்பிட்டு, மெக்கின்ஸி நிறுவனம் ஆய்வறிக்கை வெளியிட்டுள்ளது.</li>
<li>ஐ.டி நிறுவனங்களின் எதிர்பாராத வீழ்ச்சியினால், 'அமெரிக்காவிலேயே இனி ஐ.டி பணிக்கு ஆட்களைத் தேர்வுசெய்ய வேண்டும்' என அதிபர் ட்ரம்ப் உத்தரவிட்டிருப்பது இந்திய ஐ.டி நிறுவனங்களை அதிர்ச்சியில் ஆழ்த்தியிருக்கிறது.</li>
<li>பணியாளர்களுக்குப் பயிற்சி அளித்து, அவர்களின் திறனை மேம்படுத்தி, அவர்களைத் <strong>தக்கவைத்துக்கொள்ள வேண்டுமென எந்த மென்பொருள் நிறுவனமும் தயாராக இல்லை</strong> எனத் தெரிவிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.</li>
<li>இந்தப் பணி நீக்க அபாயம் பெங்களூரு, மும்பை போன்ற பெரு நகரங்களில் ஏற்பட வாய்ப்பில்லை என்றபோதிலும், <strong>கோவை போன்ற நகரங்களில் பலர் வேலையிலிருந்து நீக்கப்படுவர்</strong> எனத் தெரிவிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.</li><li>Your leadership hierarchy is literally incompetent</li><p>They tend to safeguard their job always.<p>They never say no to anything if his/her leader proposes something<p>You have open door policy but you have no openness in your work culture here in vdsi.<li>The kind of work and skills you gain at verizon is useless outside. It is very hard to find a job outside for most people unless you took time to update yourself instead of sitting on on site calls and status update call.</li><li>Few DHs are so mean who favour their dearest slave (ppl with benefits) and promote them frequently and when a concerned is raised on that particular persons knowledge, behavior, attitude they in turn try to fire the people who raised it or try find fault always to screw them.</li><p><br></p>

<p>Verizon purchased AOL in 2015. Many Yahoo and AOL employees will soon be out of a job, as Verizon is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/06/verizon-prepares-to-reap-over-2000-employees-at-aol-and-yahoo-after-merger/">reportedly planning to cut</a> about 2,100 workers from the combined organization, about 15 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Former AOL CEO Tim Armstrong is now the CEO of Oath.</p>
<p>Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has resigned from the company. Mayer is set to receive a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/03/yahoo-to-give-marissa-mayer-23-million-parting-gift-after-sale-to-verizon/">severance package worth about $23 million</a> and stock compensation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoos-marissa-mayer-to-make-186-million-from-verizon-deal-1493103650">worth about $187 million</a>.</p>

<p>Across vdsi the RIF is 12%. Total 900 people are shown pink slips out of 7k+ employees in India. Evicted employees are mostly having 12+ work experience in verizon.</p>
<p>Many people got termination call today and all final formalities finished just like that. Worst management decision.</p>
<p>I don't blame vdsi.. all i blame is the new management.. vdsi now ran by a group where they will grow their close network only.. and fire anyone.</p>

<p>இந்தியாவில் செயல்படும் வெரிஸான், 14 சதவிகித ஊழியர்களை அதிரடியாக நீக்கிவிட்டதாகக் கடந்த 12-ம் தேதி அதிகாரப்பூர்வ அறிவிப்பு வெளியிட்டுள்ளது. இதுகுறித்து நம்மிடம் பேசிய வெரிஸான் ஊழியர் ஒருவர், " வரும் 2018 பிப்ரவரி மாதத்துக்குள் 50 சதவிகித ஊழியர்களை நீக்கும் முடிவில் வெரிஸான் இருக்கிறது. சென்னையில் ஒலிம்பியா டெக் பார்க் மற்றும் தரமணி ஆர்.எம்.எக்ஸ் வளாகங்களில் செயல்படும் வெரிஸான் நிறுவனத்தில், சுமார் 3 ஆயிரம் ஊழியர்கள் பணிபுரிகின்றனர். இவர்களில் பலரும் வேலை இழந்துள்ளனர். குண்டர்களை வைத்து எங்களை வெளியேற்றுவார்கள் எனக் கனவிலும் நினைத்துப் பார்க்கவில்லை" என வேதனைப்படுகின்றனர்.</p>
<p>வெரிஸான் நிறுவனம் எந்தவொரு முன்னறிவிப்பும் இன்றி, தனது ஊழியர்களைப் பணிநீக்கம் செய்துள்ளது. அதிலும், தனியார் கன்சல்டன்ஸியின் துணையோடு அலுவலகத்திலிருந்த மூத்த ஐ.டி மேலாளர் அந்தஸ்தில் இருக்கும் ஊழியர்களை குண்டர்களை வைத்து வெளியில் துரத்தியிருக்கிறது.</p>
<p>The entire floor was watching the employee following his/her SPM and the security in civil dress to a cabin who was ready to "self-perform their personal rites" in the organization. It was very shameful for the employee to be in such a situation. This is an inhuman act.</p>
<p>It was like a play for everyone to see , in the middle of the floor, treated like terrorists.&nbsp; Many loyal employees who were technically sound were treated like **** and expelled by guards. I felt that they were backstabbed. It is embarrassing to get out of office when hundreds of employees watching you. It should have been in a different way 12/12 is like blackday for Verizon India</p>
<p>The process is like this your senior manager will call for meeting,he will take you to 8 the floor where third party ppl will be having the list of employees names and resignation letter ready ,he will say all blabla..blaba.. u r not upgrad with tech. and all those ,later they will ask u sign on the resignation letter, after that they won't allow you to take your belongings in your desk. the securit will stand behind you as u r taking company valuables,this is tooooooooo worest. Best part is they are arranging cabs to drop home and giving salary based on employees experience.</p>
<p>Compensation=(No.of years in Verizon* 1 month salary )+ 2months notice period payout.</p>
<p>BCOZ of tamilian mgmt, innocent employees are laying off. Suggestion, first remove all the Senior Mgmt who all are Tamilian including Kalyani Sekar(MD). Then come on small band (Middle and lower layer). Will be much better. Cost cutting can be manage by Removing SPM/DH/Senior DH/MD...</p>
<p>Being the Next thing is one can see Ramasubramanian Radhakrishanan who is Kalyani's relative will be moving as Senior Delivery head which is the case why Vishal bhasin was pressurised in such way that he leaves. Now this immature leader is having an immatured leadership under her, called the senior Delivery heads who doesnt understand any Technical aspects or have pure Mangerial thoughts. They are just like the Ministers of Tamilnadu. I wouldnt blame all the Delivery heads as some had given heads up for people to have a prepared mindset. But the rest of the DHs have just acted as blood s---ers.</p>
<p>VDSI is retaining psycopath like Ramesh Seshadri for so long. He gave torture to lot of employees and no action been taken yet by Bala and Kalyani. All beasts are ganging up and screwing up employees career.</p>
<p>Verizon India started the layoffs. 937 out of existing 6000 are getting laid off by Dec 15-2017 and expecting 50% layoff - approx 3500 by Feb 2018.</p>

<p>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/about-50-cognizant-employees-move-labour-court-following-forceful-resignation/articleshow/61928073.cms?from=mdr</p>
<p>However, things turned ugly again in the last couple of months with at least 10,000 staff being laid off among Cognizant's over two lakh workforce across the world.</p>
<p>In October, he was called by its HR authorities and told that he has to resign and move to Quess on contract. "The HR called me, saying that they wanted to discuss some project. Soon after entering the room, I was told that I had to resign with immediate effect. I obviously refused. Then they told me that I had two options — either resign here and switch to Quess else my service will be terminated with immediate effect with a bad review on the relieving letter.</p>
<p>I was left with no choice. I chose to resign but the new contract is just for four months. We don't know what will happen after that," he said.</p>
<p>"While they asked us to quit and move Quess, they did not give us any documentation for the same. Our HR officials also threatened that they will terminate us if we don't oblige and keep insisting for the documents. While they gave us an appointment letter for the new company, they told us not to come to office and that they would call us only when the need arose. At present, we are just idling away at home. Earlier, they asked people to quit right away. It seems that this time they chose a different way of separation."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Almost 10 per cent of workforce in every company is being laid off. To help such IT professionals, we have formed a Facebook page and a WhatsApp group. These people approached us through this. We have now approached the labour commissioner with their complaints. We are also going to help them move forward with the legal procedure.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have bought homes in Pune and have to pay EMIs for that. At present, I have already missed one EMI and if we miss two more the bank will initiate action. In addition, we have to take care of our daily needs along with education of children etc. It was not like we didn't have projects on hand to work on. We could've understood if this was cost cutting.</p>
<p>If someone is a bad performer, then no company will continue with them for 10 years. Despite projects being allocated, they have done this as hardly any job is available in the IT sector</p>
