<ul><li>Workflow? </li><li>Workflow is fundamentally about the organization of work. It is a set of activities that coordinate people and / or software. </li><li>Communicating this organization to humans and automated processes is the value-add that workflow provides to our solutions.</li><li>Workflow may consist of other workflows (each of which may consist of aggregated services). The workflow model encourages reuse and agility, leading to more flexible business processes.</li></ul>

<p>“A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, declared as work of a person or group, an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.”</p>

<p><strong>Workflows </strong>are the way people get work done, and <strong>can be illustrated as series of steps that need to be completed sequentially in a diagram or checklist.</strong></p>

Often, in business, workflows are much more complicated. Something like employee onboarding might involve multiple meetings, reports, tasks, and departments. It’s at this level that they need to be properly monitored, managed and optimized to make sure they’re as efficient as they can be.

<h2>Designing workflow</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Designing Workflow Architect may use two mode either a Textual or Graphical, it is also known as PDL (Process Definition Language) it is very simple language similar to structure language like English. Workflow can basically be defined by three parameters</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Input description: the information, material and energy required to complete the step</li><li>transformation rules, algorithms, which may be carried out by associated human roles or machines, or a combination</li><li>Output description: the information, material and energy produced by the step and provided as input to downstream steps.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Workflow Lifecycle:</strong>&nbsp;An individual business process may have a life cycle ranging from minutes to days (or even months), depending upon its complexity and the duration of the various constituent activities. Such systems may be implemented in A variety of ways, use a wide variety of IT and communications infrastructure and operate in an environment Ranging from small local workgroup to inter-enterprise.

<h2><strong>Building the Messaging Architecture</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is foremost important that the design of Messaging Architecture is such that the messaging framework must be capable of supporting the publish-and-subscribe MEP (Message Exchange Pattern) and associated complex event processing and tracking. One of the problems with the distributed systems built today is that they are fragile. As one part of the system slows down, the effect tends to ripple out and cripple the entire system. One of the primary design goals of ESB should be to eliminate that, the guideline should be available to developers to write code that is robust in production environments. That robustness prevents data loss under failure conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make effective use of ESB, it is important to understand the distributed systems architecture. If you are designing your system according to the principles as per the pattern it will make your life a lot easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The communications pattern that enables robustness is one-way messaging, also known as “fire and forget”. Since the amount of time it can take to communicate with another machine across the network is both unknown and unbounded, communications are based on a store-and-forward model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Message Exchange Pattern</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Datagram</li><li>Request-response</li><li>Duplex</li><li>Datagram with sessions</li><li>Request-response with sessions</li><li>Duplex with sessions</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Messaging pattern is important part of the ESB in the SOA architecture, an&nbsp;enterprise service bus&nbsp;(ESB) being a&nbsp;model used for designing and implementing communication between mutually interacting software applications in a&nbsp;service-oriented architecture&nbsp;(SOA).&nbsp; How the Message?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>How the Monitoring and control routing of message can be exchange between services</li><li>How to resolve contention between communicating service components</li><li>How to control deployment and versioning of services</li><li>How to Marshal use of redundant services</li><li>How to cater for commodity services like event handling, data transformation and mapping, message and event queuing and sequencing, security or&nbsp;exception handling and protocol conversion</li><li>How to enforce proper quality of communication service</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three basic message exchange patterns mostly followed are datagram, request-response, and duplex.</p>
