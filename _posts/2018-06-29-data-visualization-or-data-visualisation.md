 	<li>Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects (e.g., points, lines or bars) contained in graphics.</li>
 	<li>It involves the creation and study of the <a title="Visual system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system">visual</a> representation of <a title="Data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a>, meaning "information that has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of <a title="Information" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-MF08_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#cite_note-MF08-1">[1]</a></sup></li>
 	<li>A primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently via <a title="Statistical graphics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_graphics">statistical graphics</a>, <a title="Plot (graphics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(graphics)">plots</a> and <a title="Infographic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic">information graphics</a>. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#cite_note-ReferenceA-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
 	<li>Effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence. It makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable. Users may have particular analytical tasks, such as making comparisons or understanding <a title="Causality" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality">causality</a>, and the design principle of the graphic (i.e., showing comparisons or showing causality) follows the task. Tables are generally used where users will look up a specific measurement, while charts of various types are used to show patterns or relationships in the data for one or more variables.</li>
 	<li>Data visualization is both an art and a science.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#cite_note-3">[3]</a> </sup></li>
 	<li><b>Data presentation architecture</b> (<b>DPA</b>) is a skill-set that seeks to identify, locate, manipulate, format and present data in such a way as to optimally communicate meaning and proper knowledge.</li>

Eight types of quantitative messages
<ol>
 	<li>Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A <a title="Line chart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart">line chart</a> may be used to demonstrate the trend.</li>
 	<li>Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the <i>measure</i>) by sales persons (the <i>category</i>, with each sales person a <i>categorical subdivision</i>) during a single period. A <a title="Bar chart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart">bar chart</a> may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.</li>
 	<li>Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%). A <a title="Pie chart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart">pie chart</a> or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.</li>
 	<li>Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period. A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.</li>
 	<li>Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0-10%, 11-20%, etc. A <a title="Histogram" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a>, a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis. A <a title="Boxplot" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxplot">boxplot</a> helps visualize key statistics about the distribution, such as median, quartiles, outliers, etc.</li>
 	<li>Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A <a title="Scatter plot" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">scatter plot</a> is typically used for this message.</li>
 	<li>Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.</li>
 	<li>Geographic or geospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A <a title="Cartogram" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram">cartogram</a> is a typical graphic used.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#cite_note-ReferenceA-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></li>
