<h2>Salary expectation</h2>
There is a variety of <strong>compensation survey data</strong> available online. These give factual data for you to suggest possible numbers. It is good to indicate that you will go as per company standards. Another option is to suggest a percentage range but be prepared to handle further queries.
<div align="left"><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.resumagic.com/job_interview_questions_22.html"><b>Why should we pay you the salary you're requesting?  </b></a>
</span></div>
<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Self awareness:</strong> </span></div>
<ul>
 	<li><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Make yourself stand out with your skills, education and beaming personality. Be honest, are you worth what you think you are worth?</span></li>
 	<li>The best way to do this is to point out <strong style="color: #000000; font-size: 1rem;">how you have benefited your past employers in terms of increasing profit, reducing expenses, improving efficiency, etc</strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Good answer:  "Last year I <strong>exceeded my annual sales quota</strong> by $500,000 and <strong>gross profit</strong> by 30 percent.  I <strong>achieved</strong> over $3.5 million in sales in a two year period setting a company record for most new accounts created in one quarter.  I intend to bring in much more each year for your company than I will earn.  Therefore, I believe this is a very fair salary."</span></div>
<h3><strong>Salary Negotiation Tips</strong></h3>
<ol>
 	<li><b>1. Ask for a meeting.</b></li>
 	<li><strong>1)  When negotiating a job offer is to keep things positive</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Show gratitude for the offer and enthusiasm about the potential of the position before you dive into negotiating mode.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><b><strong>2) Make your counter offer one that is fair, well-reasoned, and thoughtfully presented.</strong></b>
<ol>
 	<li>SHOW THAT YOU’VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK
<ol>
 	<li>You should have done some research before the interview to find out the <a href="http://career-advice.monster.com/salary-benefits/salary-information/earning-salary-fair-what-worth/article.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">common salary range</a> for your<strong> position and level of experience, location</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><b>2. Propose a range with strategic “anchor” numbers.</b></li>
 	<li>negotiation method as “tandem anchoring,” the <strong>low end of the range should be your target salary</strong>, and the high number should be more ambitious.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>3) The third tip, </strong>and perhaps the most important when it comes to your <a href="https://biginterview.com/blog/2018/03/career-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term career goals</a>, is this: be willing to walk away if the offer isn’t right for you.</li>
 	<li>Check / negotiate other benefits
<ol>
 	<li><em>Performance bonuses</em></li>
 	<li><em>Signing bonuses</em></li>
 	<li><em>Future pay raises / Earlier pay review</em></li>
 	<li><em>Company stock</em></li>
 	<li><em>Retirement contributions</em></li>
 	<li><em>Health benefits </em>An upgraded health care or retirement plan</li>
 	<li><em>Additional vacation days</em></li>
 	<li>Educational benefits</li>
 	<li><em>Flexible work hours / </em>The flexibility to work from home in a part-time capacity during the week</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>3. Avoid certain words and phrases. </strong>
<ol>
 	<li> emphasizes the importance of confidence overall, and warns against using all “uncertain words” including “I think” and “maybe.”</li>
 	<li>At the same time, its important not to be overly aggressive. Statements such as, “this is my bottom line” or “this is my final/last offer,” for example can come across as hostile, and even end a negotiation altogether</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>4. Don’t be afraid of “No.”</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Avoid this instinct. If your first offer is refused, take a moment to collect yourself and calmly and confidently return with a counteroffer (that you prepared prior to the conversation).</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>5. Don’t <em>say</em> “No.”</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Similarly, if an employer proposes a number that’s lower than what you want, don’t simply walk away — at least not right away. Instead, treat the figure as a jumping off point and respectfully return with a counteroffer.</li>
 	<li>you should come back with a number or range of your own if your employer’s proposal “isn’t in line with what you are seeking.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>6. Don’t use another offer as leverage.</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>using it is more likely to result in resentment or an ugly argument than a bouquet of fresh flowers.</li>
 	<li>“Only discuss the offer at hand,” instructs workplace expert <a href="http://www.lynntaylorconsulting.com/">Lynn Taylor</a>, <em>especially</em> if it’s actually the only one you have.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Scenario #4:</strong><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Unfortunately, my budget does not support the rate you mentioned. Are you willing to accept a salary of $40,000?

I am willing to consider, as I am passionate about the work your company does. I am assuming the salary is fair and matches the responsibilities involved?</li>
 	<li><strong>Wait for the appropriate time.</strong> Once you know what you <em>should</em> be earning, how do you go about getting it? Start by being very patient. When interviewing for a new position, do your best not to bring up compensation until the employer makes you an offer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Resist throwing out the first number.</strong> If you're asked what your <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/when-and-how-to-disclose-your-salary-requirements-2058756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">salary requirements</a> are, say that they are open based upon the position and the overall compensation package. Or tell the employer you'd like to know more about the responsibilities and the challenges of the job prior to discussing salary. (Here are <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/interview-questions-about-your-salary-expectations-2061235" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">tips for answering interview questions about your salary expectations</a>.)</li>
 	<li><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Base your salary request on data.</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> If you’re forced to give a number, provide a </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-salary-range-2063398" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5">salary range</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> based upon the research you've done up front. Use this research to inform your negotiating technique. Talk about what’s appropriate for the role, based on your experience and what you have to offer. Resist the temptation to talk about your personal financial needs.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Take your time.</strong> Once you've received the offer, you don't need to accept (or reject) it right away. A simple "I need to think it over" can get you an increase in the original offer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consider saying no.</strong> If you're ambivalent about the position, a "no" can bring you a better offer too. I turned down a position I knew I didn't want, regardless of salary, and received three follow-up phone calls upping the compensation package.</li>
 	<li><strong>But don’t decline a job that you want or need.</strong> Be careful though, if you do definitely need <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-negotiate-accept-or-decline-a-job-offer-2061398" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6">that new job</a> there's a risk that the employer may accept your declining the position and move on to the next candidate.</li>
 	<li><strong>Negotiate benefits.</strong> Consider whether there are <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/employee-perks-you-can-negotiate-in-a-job-offer-4141190" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7">employee benefits and perks that might be negotiable</a>, even if the salary isn't.</li>

</span></div>
<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Those who answer this question with, "Not much," will probably not be offered the job.  You should always <strong>research a company before the interview</strong>.  Learn about their products / services, size, plans, current events, etc.  If you cannot find information about a particular company, call their offices and ask the receptionist to send you information about the company in the form of a brochure, etc.  You should also <strong>research the industry</strong> in which the company operates so you are up on what's happening. </span></div>

</span>

</div>
<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Your answer should offer what you think are the most interesting aspects of the position.  More responsibility and opportunity, including a higher salary, are acceptable answers, but state them in a way that <strong>isn't blunt.</strong>  For example, "because it pays more" is not a good answer.  However, stating that, "<strong>The position offers more responsibility, challenges and interesting opportunities, as well as a higher salary,</strong>" is a good answer.</span></div>

</div>

<div align="left"><span class="size10 Helvetica10" style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Most people would respond with an answer avowing a deep commitment to the company and the job; however, a better answer would be to <strong>state that your commitment would grow as you get to know the company and the people in it</strong>.</span></div>

<h2>Describe a typical work week for technical architect position?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Interviewers expect a candidate for employment to discuss what they do while they are working in detail. Before you answer, consider the position you are applying for and how your current or past positions relate to it. The more you can connect your past experience with the job opening, the more successful you will be at answering the questions.</li>
 	<li>It should be obvious that it's not a good idea talk about non-work related activities that you do on company time, but, I've had applicants tell me how they are often late because they have to drive a child to school or like to take a long lunch break to work at the gym.</li>
 	<li>Keep your answers focused on work and show the interviewer that you're organized ("The first thing I do on Monday morning is check my voicemail and email, then I prioritize my activities for the week.") and efficient.</li>
</ul>
Tell me a suggestion you have made that was implemented in this architect field?
<h2>What experience do you have in this architect field?</h2>
It's important here to focus on the word "<strong>implemented</strong>." There's nothing wrong with having a thousand great ideas, but if the only place they live is on your notepad what's the point? Better still, you need a <strong>good ending</strong>. If your previous company took your advice and ended up going bankrupt, that's not such a great example either. Be prepared with a story about an idea of yours that was taken from idea to implementation, and considered successful.
<h2>What are your career goals for Solution architect?</h2>
a. The reasons of this question:

This question will test your ability and ambition to develop yourself as well as the ability to plan for the future.

b. Levels of career goals:

• You are not sure about your goals, then answer: I’m rather busy with my duties and goals of the Company; as a result, I haven’t focused much on my long-term personal goals.

• You have goals not or very little relating to the current job: For example, you are applying for a sales manager, but your career goal is to become the head of marketing department in the next 5 years.

• Current job oriented career goals: For example, you are working as a sales manager, you goal is to become the area sales manager in the next 2 years and in the next 5 years, you will be the regional sales manager.
<h2><b><i>What challenges are you looking for in this technical architect position?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h2>
A typical interview question to determine what you are looking for your in next job, and whether you would be a good fit for the position being hired for, is "What challenges are you looking for in a position?"

The best way to answer questions about the <strong>challenges you are seeking is to discuss</strong> how you would like to be <strong>able to effectively utilize your skills and experience if you were hired for the job</strong>.

You can also mention that you are motivated by challenges, have the ability to effectively meet challenges, and have the flexibility and skills necessary to handle a challenging job.

You can continue by describing specific examples of challenges you have met and goals you have achieved in the past.
<h2><b><i>What have you done to improve your Solution architect knowledge in the last year?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h2>
a. Answer tips

• Try to include <strong>improvement activities that relate to the job</strong>. A wide variety of activities can be mentioned as positive self-improvement. Have some good ones handy to mention.

• Employers look for applicants who are<strong> goal-oriented. Show a desire for continuous learning by listing hobbies</strong> non-work related. Regardless of what hobbies you choose to showcase, remember that the goal is to prove self-sufficiency, time management, and motivation.

b. Answer samples

•• I <strong>enrolled myself into a course useful</strong> for the next version of our current project. I attended seminars on personal development and managerial skills improvement.
<h2><b><i>Why should the we hire you as </i></b><b><i>technical architect position?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h2>
This is the part where you link your skills, experience, education and your personality to the job itself. This is why you need to be utterly familiar with the job description as well as the company culture. Remember though, it’s best to back them up with actual examples of say, how you are a good team player.

It is possible that you may not have as much skills, experience or qualifications as the other candidates. What then, will set you apart from the rest? <strong>Energy and passion might.</strong> People are attracted to someone who is charismatic, who show immense amount of energy when they talk, and who love what it is that they do. As you explain your compatibility with the job and company, be sure to portray yourself as that motivated, confident and energetic person, ever-ready to commit to the cause of the company.

<strong>4.Why did you leave your last job?</strong>
<h6><b>. Some sample answers to the interview question: “Why are you leaving your last job?”</b><b></b></h6>
Often a common reason for leaving is a dissatisfaction over pay, hours, projects, co-workers, etc. Try a specific example like, "I know you have an <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/office-buildings">office</a> project that has just started design development and at my previous employer we focused mainly on design competitions. The majority of my experience is with the later project phases so I am looking to leverage my knowledge base in a new environment." Saying something like this can further emphasize your fit with the firm while not speaking negatively about your previous employer.

• There is no opportunity to promote in my current job and I’m ready to face a new challenge;
• I have worked there for 04 years with much experience and skills. I want to be promoted but the Company do not offer me that opportunity;
• The company has cut down with its focus on the business line my job is responsible for;
• My family transferred to another region, or, my current workplace is too far away from my home;
• My old company often paid late and had inadequate compensation policy.
<h6><b>b. You should avoid answers that:</b><b></b></h6>
• Speak ill of your old boss, colleague, etc.;
• They punished me many times for…
• I did not complete my job.

5. Do you have any other offers? / Are you interviewing anywhere else?

If you have other job offers, that is fine go ahead and say so. If not, don’t try to leverage your situation.

<strong>Question: Do you have any other offers?</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Response: No, I am selectively looking for the right fit.</li>
 	<li>I am currently interviewing at other firms. I am looking for a long term move so I want to make sure I make the right decision.</li>
</ol>
This doesn’t present your current situation as an ultimatum but helps your case by explaining why you are looking at several offers and wraps it in your commitment to a firm when you do join.

2. What are your biggest strengths?

This question will help polishing your qualification to the requirements of the employer.

Steps to answer this question:

a) Identify which you are good at:

• Knowledge;

• Experience;

• Skills;

• Abilities.

b) Prepare a list of your strong points:

c) Review the recruitment requirements:

You should review carefully the recruitment requirements to know for sure which requirements are the most important to the employer.

d) Make a list of your strong points in your resume/cover letter:

List and describe your strong points in your resume and cover letter orderly.

You should make descriptions to those points in your resume.

e) Prepare persuasive answers to the question of the employer about strong points:

You do not only state your strong points to the employer but must also provide evidence for them by references or records attached with your application form.

Useful source: List of strong points:

<a href="http://interview-tips-123.blogspot.com/2013/05/list-of-strong-points.html"><u>http://interview-tips-123.blogspot.com/2013/05/list-of-strong-points.html</u></a>
<h4><b><i>5. What is your greatest weakness?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h4>
<blockquote>
<h5><b>Ways to answer:</b><b></b></h5>
<b>a) First way</b>: Turning your strong point into weak point.

For example: I am a perfectionist and therefore, I rarely believe in anyone who can work as well as me. As a result, I am afraid to delegate important tasks to others.

This approach has a weak side as that if you are not clever, you will cause the employer to believe that you are cheating him.

<b>b) Second way:</b> Solving your weakness absolutely.

A better approach is that you state one point which was once your weakness, but you have done well to resolve it.

For example: I tended to be a perfectionist, therefore I didn’t like to delegate to others. But I have found out that in order to develop the organization, everyone in the organization must be experienced with many tasks and this is very good for an efficient team work.

---

No one likes to answer this question because it requires a very delicate balance. You simply can’t lie and say you don’t have one; you can’t trick the interviewer by offering up a personal weakness that is really a strength (“Sometimes, I work too much and don’t maintain a work-life balance.”); and you shouldn’t be so honest that you throw yourself under the bus (“I’m not a morning person so I’m working on getting to the office on time.”)

Think of a small flaw like “I sometimes get sidetracked by small details”, “I am occasionally not as patient as I should be with subordinates or co-workers who do not understand my ideas”, or “I am still somewhat nervous and uncomfortable with my public-speaking skills and would like to give more presentations and talk in front of others or in meetings.” Add that you are aware of the problem and you are doing your best to correct it by taking a course of action.</blockquote>
<h4><b><i>Have you ever had a conflict with a boss or professor? How was it resolved?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h4>
<blockquote>Note that if you say no, most interviewers will keep drilling deeper to find a conflict. The key is how you behaviourally reacted to conflict and what you did to resolve it.

For example: “Yes, I have had conflicts in the past. Never major ones, but there have been disagreements that needed to be resolved. I've found that when conflict occurs, it helps to fully understand the other person’s perspective, so I take time to listen to their point of view, and then I seek to work out a collaborative solution. For example . . .”

Focus your answer on the behavioural process for resolving the conflict and working collaboratively.</blockquote>
<h4><b><i>6. </i></b><b><i>What do you know about this organization?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h4>
This question is one reason to do some research on the organization before the interview. Find out where they have been and where they are going. What are the current issues and who are the major players?

Sample answers:

a. A good organization with perfect management. I heard that in this organization i can gain knowledge and good atmosphere.

b. If its for a good renowned company then its better to go through the company website and know what’s the company profile and what’s their achievements/successes and branches &amp; other details.

c. According to me this is one of the best company. It has a good Environment, We feel good working in companies, which has good growth in the IT Industries. This Organization has all the qualities like good growth, good Environment, maintaining a best level in the IT Industries, etc.

Follow these three easy research tips before your next job interview:

1) Visit the company website; look in the “about us” section and “careers” sections

2) Visit the company’s LinkedIn page (note, you must have a LinkedIn account — its free to sign up)  to view information about the company

3) Google a keyword search phrase like “press releases” followed by the company name; you’ll find the most recent news stories shared by the company

Remember, just because you have done your “homework”, it does not mean you need to share ALL of  it during the interview! Reciting every fact you’ve learned is almost as much of a turn off as not knowing anything at all! At a minimum, you should include the following in your answer:

1. What type of product or service the company sells

2. How long the company has been in business

3. What the company culture is like OR what the company mission statement is, and how the culture and/or mission relate to your values or personality
<h4><b><i>Why do you want to work with us?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h4>
More likely than not, the interviewer wishes to see how much you know about the company culture, and whether you can identify with the organization’s values and vision. Every organization has its strong points, and these are the ones that you should highlight in your answer. For example, if the company emphasizes on integrity with customers, then you mention that you would like to be in such a team because you yourself believe in integrity.

It doesn’t have to be a lie. In the case that your values are not in line with the ones by the company, ask yourself if you would be happy working there. If you have no issue with that, go ahead. But if you are aware of the company culture and realize that there is some dilemma you might be facing, you ought to think twice. The best policy is to be honest with yourself, and be honest with the interviewer with what is it in the company culture that motivates you.
<h4><b><i>What kind of salary do you need? </i></b><b><i></i></b></h4>
A loaded question. A nasty little game that you will probably lose if you answer first. So, do not answer it. Instead, say something like, That’s a tough question. Can you tell me the range for this position?

In most cases, the interviewer, taken off guard, will tell you. If not, say that it can depend on the details of the job. Then give a wide range.
<h4><b><i>8</i></b><b><i>. </i></b><b><i>Do you have any questions to ask us?</i></b><b><i></i></b></h4>
Never ask Salary, perks, leave, place of posting, etc. regarded questions.

Try to ask more about the company to show how early you can make a contribution to your organization like

“Sir, with your kind permission I would like to know more about induction and developmental programs?”

OR

Sir, I would like to have my feedback, so that I can analyze and improve my strengths and rectify my shortcomings.

close-ended questions that require a yes or no response. Instead, try to get the candidate talking by using open-ended and behaviour-based questions.

<a href="https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/open-ended-and-behaviour-based-interview-questions-examples/">Open-ended questions</a> require the applicant to offer more detail and demonstrate their communication skills (for example, “Tell me about a time…”).

Behaviour-based questions require the applicant to hypothesize what they would do when presented with a realistic workplace scenario. This type of framework showcases their judgment and decision-making skills.

The list below offers some sample open-ended and behaviour-based interview questions.
