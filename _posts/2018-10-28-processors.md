<h2>Moore's law and Intel</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Moore's law" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moores (first) law</a> </strong>– that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. </li>
<li><b>Rock's law</b> or <b>Moore's second law</b>, named for <a title="Arthur Rock" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rock">Arthur Rock</a> or <a title="Gordon Moore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore">Gordon Moore</a>, says that the cost of a <a title="Integrated circuit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">semiconductor chip</a> <a title="Semiconductor fabrication plant" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication_plant">fabrication plant</a> doubles every four years.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_second_law#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> As of 2015, the price had already reached about 14 billion US dollars.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_second_law#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Advancements in digital electronics are strongly linked to Moore's law: <a title="Price index" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index#Quality_change">quality-adjusted</a> <a title="Microprocessor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor">microprocessor</a> prices,<sup id="cite_ref-Byrne2013a_11-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#cite_note-Byrne2013a-11">[11]</a></sup> <a title="Random-access memory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">memory capacity</a>, <a title="Digital sensor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_sensor">sensors</a> and even the number and size of <a title="Pixel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixels</a> in <a title="Digital camera" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera">digital cameras</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Digital electronics has contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Intel has been doggedly upholding Moore's Law by roughly doubling the number of transistors in its processors every couple of years, but now that schedule is starting to slip.</li>
<li><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->For a number of years now, Intel has been adhering to a tick-tock strategy in improving its chips: the tick is a shrinking of the manufacturing process, while the tock is an optimization of the design and architecture at a given size.</li>
<li><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->But the infamous Moore’s Law <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/16/8976223/intel-q2-2015-earnings-moores-law-skylake-kaby-lake-cannonlake">sputtered to an end back in 2015</a>. Intel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/9/8919091/ibm-7nm-transistor-processor">approaching the limits</a> of what’s possible to achieve with silicon, and it hasn’t yet figured out its next step.

<h2>Mobile computing and Processors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mobile computing has firmly established itself as the predominant mode of use these days, and that trend will only grow more pronounced in the future. </li>
<li>The whole technology world is moving to developing and designing for mobile applications first.</li>
<li>As investment and development dollars continue flowing into the dominant mobile platforms — Android and iOS — it’s logical to expect that every useful desktop application that hasn’t yet been adapted to them already is on its way there.</li>
<li>Intel’s desktop roots keep holding it back from being competitive in that expanding market.</li>
<li><a title="Stories on new products" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm Inc.</a>, the biggest mobile phone chip provider, is working with PC makers to introduce new thin and light laptops based on its chips in another attempt to steal share from Intel.</li>
<li>Microsoft Corp. is supporting that effort by providing a version of its Windows operating system for ARM technology-based chips.</li>
<li>Apple’s primary software focus is rightly fixed on iOS, which happens to run on ARM instructions, not Intel’s x86. </li>
<li>Apple is planning to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-is-said-to-plan-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020">replace Intel processors in Mac computers</a> with its own chips starting sometime around 2020.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Mobile processors vs Desktop processors</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A smartphone processor is a System on Chip (SoC) which can be as small as a coin does wonder when combined with adequate software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a few key differences between smartphone processors and desktop processors that set the latter apart.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU Architecture:</strong> System on a Chip</li>
<li><strong>Instruction Set Architecture:</strong> ARM vs. x86</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Heat</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, the SoC is a single chip roughly the same size as a desktop CPU, but it also houses a GPU (a graphics processing unit, another separate PC component), various radios, sensors, security layers, and device features. Remember, manufacturers <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-the-difference-between-an-apu-a-cpu-and-a-gpu-makeuseof-explains/">pack all of this into a single chip</a>. The following image shows the Samsung Galaxy S8’s Exynos 8895 SoC CPU capabilities.</li>
<li><br />
<p id="hcxOvjK"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1790 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd5ce96240d7.png" alt="" /></p>
</li>
<li>Mobile chips are much smaller and less powerful than desktop chips, but they can be found in use in inexpensive, appliance-like laptops.</li>
<li>CPUs found in laptops or desktops do not have the same thermal and power constraints as a mobile device, and while their power generally goes under-utilized, they are an order of magnitude faster than the chip in your smartphone.</li>
<li>Mobile chips are built from the ground up for efficiency, and for integrating as many features as possible on to the CPU die.  Desktop chips have become more integrated over time, but a far larger proportion of the desktop CPU's transistors is actually dedicated to computing, rather than I/O, radios, networking, and more.  </li>
<li>By comparison, this is a diagram of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip - this is a high performance SoC (system on a chip) that is used in high end phones and tablets</li>
<li>The desktop Intel CPU above can consume 140 watts of power on its own. A typical smartphone CPU (+gpu and more) might be limited to 2W-3 by contrast (around 22 times less).</li>
<li>In addition to this, a chip in a smartphone needs to be designed in a way that it does not use too much power. If it uses more power, it would get much hotter, drain your battery much faster, and could make the device hot enough that it could literally burn you.</li>
</ul>
<p id="nmpkVQX"><img class="size-full wp-image-1789  aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd5a7f19763a.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, the “mobile” tag is a little misleading as it covers such a broad spectrum of devices; smartphones, laptops, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_of_things">internet of things</a> (IoT) devices, and more.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the big players in the desktop chip-making market—Intel and AMD—don’t have much say in the smartphone microprocessor market. Both manufacturers sold their smartphone divisions, deciding against competing with Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, and other mobile chip manufacturing giants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instruction Set Architecture: ARM vs. x86</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desktop Processor: Intel licenses their x86 CPU design to AMD and VIA Technologies. </li>
<li>
<p>Smartphones are different. ARM design and license the majority of smartphone processors to manufacturers such as Qualcomm, Apple, and so on. But the key difference is knowing that an ARM smartphone microprocessor design favors both performance and battery life, rather than the outright power of a desktop CPU. Here’s why.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARM SoC CPUs</strong> use what is known as Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). RISC instruction sets are smaller, require less energy to process, and complete quickly, freeing up system resources or allowing the device to “idle” to save battery.</li>
<li><strong>Intel x86 CPUs</strong> use what is known as Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC). CISC instruction sets are vastly more complex, adding together strings containing multiple instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qualcomm vs MediaTek </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While Qualcomm is more famous in the United States and Europe, MediaTek has slowly captured a relatively larger market share in South Asian markets.</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> One problem with Qualcomm processor was that they were a bit too expensive for OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) to blend into their smartphones and yet sell them at lower prices. This is where MediaTek targeted and brought in its relatively cheaper range of processors.</li>
<li><strong>Cores VS Efficiency:</strong> While most of the chipsets from MediaTek focus on more power, Qualcomm chipsets are more about efficiency. This is why smartphones, and especially budget smartphones running MediaTek processors would easily outgun the ones running its Qualcomm equivalent. However, a lot of times more power in MediaTek processors came with the unnecessary compromise on battery life and overheating issues.</li>
<li>MediaTek processors are generally coupled with Mali GPU which is produced by ARM while Qualcomm combines in its Adreno lineup of GPUs. They are easier to develop games on and hence, developers always dive in for Adreno GPUs. </li>
<li>If you are going for a budget device and want no compromise on power, MediaTek chipsets will surely serve you better. On the other hand, if you are someone who wants an overall efficiency and better developer support, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon range of chipsets wins it any day. </li>

<p>The fact is that for Windows performance, processor power is only one factor – hard disk speed and memory play important roles too.</p>
