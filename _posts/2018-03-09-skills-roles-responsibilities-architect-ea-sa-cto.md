Why even need different offices for Information and Technology? A CTO creates technology to sell to customers whereas a CIO focuses on managing infrastructure for the business operations.

<strong>Chief Technology Officer- CTO</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Serves as the company's top technology architect</li>
 	<li>Runs the organization's engineering group</li>
 	<li>Uses technology to enhance the company's product offerings</li>
 	<li>Focuses on external customers (buyers)</li>
 	<li>Collaborates and manages vendors that supply solutions to enhance the company's product(s)</li>
 	<li>Aligns the company's product architecture with business priorities</li>
 	<li>Develops strategies to increase the company's top line (revenue)</li>
 	<li>Has to be a creative and innovative technologist to be successful</li>
</ul>
<strong>Chief Information Officer- CIO</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Serves as the company's top technology infrastructure manager</li>
 	<li>Runs the organization's internal IT operations</li>
 	<li>Works to streamline business processes with technology</li>

 	<li>Developers strategies to increase the company's bottom line (profitability)</li>
 	<li>Has to be a skilled and organized manager to be successful</li>
</ul>
<strong>Chief Data Officer - CDO
</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The CDO is not the numero uno.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>CDO reports to CIO</li>
 	<li>CIO reports to CFO</li>
</ul>
A chief data officer (CDO) is a corporate officer responsible for enterprisewide governance and utilization of information as an asset, via data processing, analysis, data mining, information trading and other means.

Enterprise Architect

I propose the an Enterprise Architect (EA) is a planning role that is responsible for identifying the future state of an organization’s IT environment and engage wherever and whomever necessary to help guide project teams to deliver toward it. To date I haven’t seen any other titles for this role. An EA would ensure IT investments are aligned with business strategy.

As well as a close relationship with the business and vendors, the role has high interaction with the CIO and in smaller organisations this role may not exist as the function is performed as part of the CIO’s role. Responsible for strategic thinking, roadmaps, principles and governance of the entire enterprise.

Solutions Architect

I propose that a Solutions Architect (SA) focuses on delivery of a particular solution. The solution architect is responsible for implementing a strategic IT program within the framework laid down by the enterprise architecture (EA) team.

Technical Architect

The technical architect is usually a technology specialist in a particular technology or group of inter-related technologies.  I have seen job titles vary for this role and they may also include Infrastructure Architect, Domain Architect, Application Architect, Network Architect, Security Architect.

<p class="ui_qtext_para"><b>A Solutions Architect</b> is a person who designs solutions and in many cases also leads the solution delivery process.</p>
<p class="ui_qtext_para"><b>A Technical Architect </b>is a person who designs technical solutions and in many cases also leads and manages the technology delivery process.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>A Technical Architect has a technology bias to solve the problems where a Solutions Architect have no biases whatsoever other than solving the problem!</li>
 	<li>A Solutions Architect may solve the problems by hiring a Technical Architect if a particular technology is not her expertise. A select few exceptions apart, a Technical Architect usually would not do that.</li>
 	<li>Technical Architect is more of an individual performer role with a technology bias to solve problems.</li>
 	<li>Solutions Architect's role is an influencer role with nothing but the solutions bias to solve problems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ui_qtext_para">So a Solutions Architect can be a superset of Technical Architect role but not vice-versa.</p>

<i>[A team is] a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.</i><a href="file:///C:/Users/tmasabari/AppData/Local/Temp/OpenLiveWriter758310246/2B41C190976E/index.htm#notes">2</a>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect understands the software development process</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Since the architect is involved on a daily basis with many of the team members, it is important for the architect to understand their roles and responsibilities. Day-to-day, the development team will often look to the architect to tell them what to do and often how to do it. There is therefore a clear overlap between the role of the architect and the role of the project manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect has knowledge of the business domain</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>[A domain is] an area of knowledge or activity characterized by a set of concepts and terminology understood by practitioners in that area. <a href="file:///C:/Users/tmasabari/AppData/Local/Temp/OpenLiveWriter758310246/2B41C190976E/index.htm#notes">4</a>
Such knowledge will allow the architect to better understand and contribute to the requirements of the system and be in a position to ensure that "likely" requirements -- i.e., requirements that, based on the architect's domain knowledge, will probably have to be considered -- are captured.
For example, if the architect is aware that new regulatory standards may need to be adhered to at some point in the future, then this should be accommodated in the architecture should such standards be mandated during the life of the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect has technology knowledge
<u></u></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><u>Since technology changes fairly frequently, it is essential that the architect keep abreast of these changes.</u><u></u></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect has design skills</h4>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect has programming skills</h4>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect is a good communicator</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Clearly, communication with stakeholders is particularly important in order to understand their needs and also to communicate the architecture in a way that secures (and maintains) agreement with all stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect makes decisions</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Such an environment is to be expected, and successful architects acknowledge the situation, rather than try to change it. Thus, the architect needs to be "thick-skinned" since they may need to correct their decisions and backtrack at times during a project.</li>
 	<li>If the architect does not make and document decisions about the architecture, then team members will start to make their own, possibly incorrect, decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect is aware of organizational politics</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Successful architects are not geeks only concerned with technology. They are also politically astute and are conscious of where the power in an organization resides. This knowledge is used to ensure that the right people are communicated with and that support for the project is aired in the right circles. <b><u>To ignore organizational politics is, quite simply, naïve.</u></b> The reality is that there are many forces at work in organizations that lie beyond the project team delivering the system, and these need to be accounted for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>The architect is a negotiator</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>This requires that the architect be an effective negotiator, able to articulate the consequences of different tradeoffs.</li>

<a href="http://www.developer.com/mgmt/article.php/3504496" target="new"><strong>Solutions Architect (SA) </strong></a>- The technical architect is responsible for transforming the requirements created by the Functional Analysts into a set of architecture and design documents that can be used by the rest of the team to actually create the solution. The Solutions Architect is typically responsible for matching technologies to the problem being solved

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>The essence of the Solution Architect (SA) role is the conversion of the requirements into an architecture and design that will become the blueprint for the solution being created.
<ul>
 	<li>This conversion is based largely upon the previous design patterns that the SA has been involved with in the past through reading and staying abreast of the latest techniques, or through personal experience.</li>
 	<li>Creating effective architectures to create a solution requires the careful balance of dozens of development concepts ranging from "Keep it Simple Stupid" to "Fail to Safe".</li>
 	<li>often a fair amount of research that happens during this phase. The research may be targeted at testing a technology that will become critical to the architecture. This process can either be done alone or depending upon the size and velocity of the project can be delegated to a development lead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>There is often a review of patterns that might be useful to the architecture. Patterns are previously described and validated approaches that can be used to create portions of the solution. Patterns are released through research and can come from places such as Microsoft's software development libraries. Reviewing the pattern allows the architect to refresh their memory on the details of the pattern and to evaluate what additional guidance they will have to provide if they choose to use the pattern.</li>
 	<li>The final component to the role of solution architect is the motivation and guidance of the development leads. Development leaders need to buy into and accept the architecture, to know how the pieces will fit together at a high level. They must also see the art portion of the architecture to get an appreciation of the subtle nuances of their portion of the architecture</li>
</ol>

<strong><span style="font-size: large;">How to become an architect ?</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-size: large;">
</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The starting point is generally being the only person on a very small, and sometimes insignificant project. The project may be small enough that a single person may fill every role - including the role of solution architect.</li>
 	<li>Another approach to becoming a SA is to become a distinguished Development Lead (DL). The SA role and the role of the DL are very similar in the skill sets needed. The SA skill set is slightly broader and requires a bit more finesse, however, fundamentally the same. The SA lays out the architecture for the overall solution whereas the DL converts that architecture into detailed design. One approach to getting started as a SA is to become a DL and work towards the additional skills that a SA possesses. Most SAs have that ability to give some of their work to DLs looking to step up.</li>
 	<li>The distinction between a development lead and the SA are often subtle. Where the development lead focuses on detailed knowledge of a particular area the SA is very broad. This allows the SA to view the problem from a different perspective.</li>
 	<li>While the development lead is responsible for their part of the solution, the SA is the proverbial one neck to choke if it doesn't all come together right. The SA has the ultimate responsibility for making the technologies work together.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">What's in their Toolbox?</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The UML structure for describing a variety of different views of the software development problem in pictorial form is the most recognizable visual documentation language for developers.</li>
 	<li>knowing how to design a database to hold the information is a critical part of the solution being successful. SAs know how to create databases and optimize them for good performance.</li>
 	<li>experience with specific tools and processes when the organization has decided upon a specific process for software development. The most common software and process is the Rational Rose Unified Process. - (Similar to EA tool - object oriented tool for UML, reverse engineering,</li>
 	<li>Perhaps the most critical skills for the SA are the ability to create consensus and understanding around the architecture. While a development lead my need to involve a few people in their detailed design the architecture of the application touches every member of the team and there's a need to get them to understand it and agree with it. Once the SA has created the architecture it's time to communicate and sell it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Good: Key, High-Value Position - The SA is a key role and one which can provide immense value if done correctly. This generally means a<strong> healthy salary</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Good: An SA is likely to get to <strong>interact with many of the key members</strong> of the development team as well as key members of the user community. This makes it a very <strong>visible</strong> position.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Bad: Hard to keep up - Being a SA means keeping up to date on a wide variety of <strong>new techniques, patterns, and tools</strong>. The effort to keep up can be very draining at times.</li>
 	<li>Bad: Difficult to get right - The role requires <strong>balancing so many factors</strong> that it's difficult to get right. In other words, it's easy to fail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Ugly: Requirements - Although a good Functional Analyst can provide great requirements a moderately skilled one may not. The difficulty is that most people, including seasoned SAs, have <strong>trouble spotting bad requirements documents</strong> before it's too late. The SA must always have to consider that the requirements may require the SA to do a lot more research and legwork into what the client really needs.</li>
 	<li>Ugly: If a project fails, the SA is at the top of the list for people to blame.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Critical Skills for Every Role</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Understanding Business</strong>-every role in the process should have an awareness and sensitivity to the business processes and needs which require technology in the first place</li>
 	<li><strong>Broad Understanding- </strong>understanding how computers work internally including memory, cache, hard drives, network etc., SMEs broad understanding of the industry,  can help you learn how to more appropriately conserve those resources.The QA team can benefit the project by a broad understanding by minimizing QA costs while improving testing coverage.</li>
 	<li><strong>Multiple Perspectives</strong>-Understanding how each person who is working on a problem views an issue - or how different customers will view the solution is important to be able to find the best solution based on all of the information.</li>
 	<li><strong>People Skills</strong>- Also known as soft skills, the ability to interact with other people and to be a part of a team</li>
 	<li><strong>Lifelong Learning</strong> - Although some might argue that the perspective of being a life long learner is more of an attitude than a skill, it is a critical part of being in a high-change industry like IT</li>
 	<li></li>
</ul>
